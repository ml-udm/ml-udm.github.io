# Workshop on Machine Learning and User Decision Making

Dates: May 23-24, 2019

Venue: 29 rue d'Ulm, Paris, France

Organizers: Laurent Massoulie (MSR-INRIA Joint Centre) and Milan Vojnovic (London School of Economics)

Scope: The scope of this workshop is to discuss important algorithmic and mathematical questions that arise at the interface between machine learning and user decision making. The subjects include but are not limited to online matching in uncertain environments, active / reinforcement learning of user and job profiles, algorithm fairness, mechanism design for online platforms, and inference of user susceptibility to influence.
